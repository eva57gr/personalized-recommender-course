## What will you learn?

The **Hands-on H&M Real-Time Personalized Recommender”** is a free course that will teach you how to build and deploy a real-time personalized recommender for H&M fashion articles using the 4-stage recommender architecture, the two-tower model design and the Hopsworks AI Lakehouse. 

You will learn:

- building a recommender using the 4-stage recommender architecture
- training a two-tower model for generating users and item embeddings
- designing a scalable ML system using the FTI architecture
- using MLOps best practices such as a feature store and model registry
- deploying the real-time personalized recommender
- enhancing recommendations with LLMs
- implementing an interactive web interface
